# ray casting demo written in rust

  

useage  
w,a,s,d to move  
j and k to turn  

there are functions commented out in stc/main that can show the status of the map in a 2d manner  

in the draw loop there is self.draw_map commented out, if you un comment it you will see the game map from top down  




  
## Problems or things to improve  
currently the ray moves in a really unoptimised manner  
proper detection of walls  
there is no collision detection
