## ray casting demo written in rust

  

useage  
w,a,s,d to move  
j and k to turn  

there are functions commented out in stc/main that can show the status of the map in a 2d manner  





  
Problems or things to improve  
currently the ray moves in a really unoptimised manner  
proper detection of walls
